Course: CSC 160 — AI for All
Date: Nov 4, 2025

TOPICS:
- AI's impact on electricity and water usage
- US power grid overview
- Data center construction delays
- Environmental facts & comparisons
- High-level industry responses (Google, Microsoft, xAI)
- Water/energy cost of LLM inference and training

AI MISINFORMATION + NOTES:
- Examples of AI-generated misinformation in political news.
- Discussion of AI music ethics and ecosystem damage.

US POWER GRID:
- US generates ~4,200 billion kWh (~480 GW average).
- Total US energy usage ~3,400 GW.
- AI datacenter growth increasing overall grid demand.

WATER & ENERGY COST OF AI:
- “Making AI Less Thirsty” research:
  • Training GPT-3 can evaporate ~700,000 liters of fresh water.
  • Future AI demand may consume 4.2–6.6 billion m³ water/year globally.
  • Approx: 1 medium ChatGPT conversation = 10–50 responses = 500 mL water (older estimate).
- Updated numbers (Altman 2025):
  • ChatGPT prompt: ~0.34 Wh, ~0.3 mL water.
  • Google Gemini: ~0.24 Wh, ~0.26 mL water.
  • Google Datacenters WUE ≈ 1.15 L/kWh.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:
- Household leaks waste 900 billion gallons/year.
- Golf courses consume ~2.08 billion gallons/day.

DATA CENTER BOTTLENECKS:
- Santa Clara: massive AI datacenter projects delayed due to lack of electrical capacity.
- Similar problems nationwide: permitting, grid upgrades, transformer shortages.

MEGA-DATACENTERS:
- Meta’s Manhattan-scale “Lego block” datacenter analogy: extremely large volumes.
- Microsoft & Google investing in new nuclear-powered datacenters.
- xAI “Colossus” project; Google exploring orbital data centers.

OVERALL THEMES:
- AI demand is outpacing grid upgrade speed.
- Water usage is a growing environmental concern.
- Industry exploring alternative energy sources (nuclear, space-based).
