Linked List – Concise Overview

A linked list is a linear data structure made of nodes, where each node contains:
- data: the stored value
- next: a reference to the next node (for singly linked lists)

Types:
1. Singly Linked List – nodes point to the next node only.
2. Doubly Linked List – nodes have next and prev references.
3. Circular Linked List – last node points back to the first.

Key operations:
- insert at head/tail
- delete a node
- search for a value
- traversal

Advantages:
- Dynamic size
- Efficient insertions/deletions (O(1) with pointer)

Disadvantages:
- No random access (O(n) search)
- Extra memory for pointers

Common uses:
- Implementing queues/stacks
- Adjacency lists in graphs
- Memory-efficient dynamic structures
