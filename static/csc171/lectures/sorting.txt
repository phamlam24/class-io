Sorting Algorithms – Concise Overview

Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order (usually ascending).

1. Bubble Sort
- Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if out of order.
- Time: O(n²), Space: O(1)

2. Selection Sort
- Repeatedly selects the smallest element and places it in order.
- Time: O(n²), Space: O(1)

3. Insertion Sort
- Inserts each element into its correct position in the sorted portion.
- Time: O(n²), Space: O(1)
- Fast for nearly sorted input.

4. Merge Sort
- Divide-and-conquer: splits list, sorts halves, merges.
- Time: O(n log n), Space: O(n)
- Stable and efficient.

5. Quick Sort
- Chooses a pivot, partitions, recursively sorts.
- Time: avg O(n log n), worst O(n²), Space: O(log n)
- Very fast in practice.

6. Heap Sort
- Uses a binary heap to repeatedly extract max/min.
- Time: O(n log n), Space: O(1)

Selecting a sorting algorithm depends on input size, memory needs, and stability requirements.
