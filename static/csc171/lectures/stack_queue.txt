Stack and Queue – Concise Overview

1. Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.
Key operations:
- push(x): Add an element to the top.
- pop(): Remove and return the top element.
- peek/top(): View the top element without removing it.
Common uses:
- Function call stack and recursion
- Undo operations in editors
- Expression parsing (prefix/infix/postfix)

2. Queue
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle.
Key operations:
- enqueue(x): Insert an element at the back.
- dequeue(): Remove and return the front element.
- front(): View the front element without removing it.
Common uses:
- Task scheduling
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Buffering in data streams

Both structures are fundamental abstractions for controlling order of processing in algorithms and systems.
